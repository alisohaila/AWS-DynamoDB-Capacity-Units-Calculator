# AWS-DynamoDB-Capacity-Units-Calculator

Hi there, 

I was watching this AWS Certified Developer Associate's training course and got to the section of DynamoDB. Apparently, there are several kinds of calculations to get done during the creation & configuration of a DynamoDB table (different calculations for both Read Unit Capacities and Write Unit Capacities, involving the possible inputs as strongly/evenutually consistent reads, or standard/transactional writes), and I was told that this calculation was going to come up on the actual DVA-C01 exam as well. 

Thus, I thought of coding out the capacity units calculation program for "fun", although it definitely took me 2 hours to complete... but was worth it.

Thanks!
